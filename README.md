# MongoDB Aggregation: Handling Missing Fields in $match Stage

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: how to handle cases where a field specified in the `$match` stage might be missing from some documents in the collection.  Improper handling can lead to pipeline failure.

## Problem

The provided JavaScript code uses an aggregation pipeline with a `$match` stage to filter documents based on a field called `fieldName`. However, if some documents in the collection lack this field, the aggregation will fail with an error indicating that the field was not found. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding an extra `$match` before using other stages like `$group` to check the existence of the field using `$exists` operator.
